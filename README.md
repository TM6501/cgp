# cgp
A general purpose, extensible, CGP library in Python.

CGP is a library which implements a general purpose Cartesian Genetic Programming framework.

It includes many different CGP-individual types and is built to allow more types to be added easily.

It ties in with, and includes fitness functions for testing with, the OpenAI Gym environments.

It has been tested and functions properly with Python 3.5.2 and the latest version of OpenAI Gym.

CGP doesn't include any code known not to work with more recent Python versions, it just hasn't been tested and confirmed to work with newer Python versions.
